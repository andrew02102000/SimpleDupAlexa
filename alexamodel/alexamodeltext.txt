Alexa Model

1.First step 
install few packages
  1.speech_recognition - to recognize our speech
  2.pyttsx3 - to convert our audio to text
  3.pyaudio - to give audio response
  4.pywhatkit - to search in google for our needed searches
  5.datetime

2.test Voice recognition package

import speech_recognition as sr
listener = sr.Recognizer()
try:
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
         print('listening..')
         voice = listener.listen(source)
         command = listener.recognize_google(voice)
         command = command.lower()
         if 'alexa'in command:
          print(command)
except:
    pass
// can test computer recognize our voice or not?

3.Adding pyttsx3 package and its coding

//alexa introduces and receive our command

import speech_recognition as sr
import pyttsx3
listener = sr.Recognizer()
engine = pyttsx3.init()
engine.say('Iam your Alexa')
engine.say('What can I do for you')
engine.runAndWait()
try:
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
         print('listening..')
         voice = listener.listen(source)
         command = listener.recognize_google(voice)
         command = command.lower()
         if 'alexa'in command:
          print(command)
except:
    pass

4.change Alexa voice and listen and gets our voice 

import speech_recognition as sr
import pyttsx3


listener = sr.Recognizer()
engine = pyttsx3.init()
voices = engine.getProperty('voices')
engine.setProperty('voice', voices[1].id)
engine.say('I am your alexa')
engine.say('what can i do for you')
engine.runAndWait()
try:
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print('listening..')
        voice = listener.listen(source)
        command = listener.recognize_google(voice)
        command = command.lower()
        if 'alexa' in command:
         print(command)
except:
    pass

5. Alexa will repeat whataver we speak to her

import speech_recognition as sr
import pyttsx3


listener = sr.Recognizer()
engine = pyttsx3.init()
voices = engine.getProperty('voices')
engine.setProperty('voice', voices[1].id)


def talk(text):
   engine.say(text)
   engine.runAndWait()

try:
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print('listening..')
        voice = listener.listen(source)
        command = listener.recognize_google(voice)
        command = command.lower()
        if 'alexa' in command:
         talk(command)
except:
    pass

6.Alexa gives our asked song on Youtube


import speech_recognition as sr
import pyttsx3
import pywhatkit


listener = sr.Recognizer()
engine = pyttsx3.init()
voices = engine.getProperty('voices')
engine.setProperty('voice', voices[1].id)


def talk(text):
   engine.say(text)
   engine.runAndWait()

def take_command():
    try:
        with sr.Microphone() as source:
            print('listening..')
            voice = listener.listen(source)
            command = listener.recognize_google(voice)
            command = command.lower()
            if 'alexa' in command:
                command = command.replace('alexa', '')
                print(command)
    except:
        pass
    return command

def run_alexa():
    command = take_command()
    print(command)
    if 'play' in command:
        song = command.replace('play', '')
        talk('playing ' + song)
        pywhatkit.playonyt(song)
